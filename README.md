# Hi there.

I'm know some things. 

I know modern AI inside-and-out. From deriving neural network gradients by hand, all the way to pretraining and deployment of custom large transformer models on specialized hardware, in the cloud.

I also happen to know some chemistry and have taken interest in metabolomics. So far, only [one](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.24.605006v1) paper under the belt - I'm sure this will improve. I'm also really interested in computational quantum chemistry. I don't know why - simulating a slice of the world just makes me feel good.
