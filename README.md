# Hi there.

I make GPUs go BRRRRR. I also know AI inside-and-out. I've been there and worked on actual AI before current `AI = LLMs` became a thing.

I also happen to know some chemistry and have taken interest in metabolomics. So far, only [one paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/41/3/btaf081/8026685) under the belt - this count will definitely improve. I'm also really interested in computational quantum chemistry. I don't know why - simulating a slice of the world just makes me feel good.
